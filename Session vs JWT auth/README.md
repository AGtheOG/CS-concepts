# Session-based vs JWT-based Authentication

Authentication is a critical part of web applications, and two common approaches are **session-based authentication** and **JWT-based authentication**. Below, we break down how each works, their pros, and their cons.

## Session-based Authentication (Cookie + Server Memory)

1. **Login Request**: The client sends `{email, password}` to the server.
2. **Server Authenticates**: If credentials are correct, the server stores user information in its memory (a session store) and generates a unique **Session ID**.
3. **Send Session ID**: The server sends the Session ID back to the client as a cookie.
4. **Subsequent Requests**: The client automatically attaches the Session ID cookie to every HTTP request.
5. **Validation**: The server looks up the Session ID in its memory to identify the user.
6. **Response**: If the Session ID is valid, the server processes the request and sends a response.

### ðŸ”´ Downsides
- **Server Memory Load**: The server must maintain memory/storage for all active sessions, which can be resource-intensive at scale.
- **Scaling Challenges**: Scaling across multiple servers is complex unless a centralized session store (e.g., Redis) is used.

## JWT-based Authentication (Token + Signature)

1. **Login Request**: The client sends `{email, password}` to the server.
2. **Server Authenticates**: If credentials are correct, the server creates a **JWT** (JSON Web Token) that encodes user data (e.g., user ID, role, expiry time) and signs it with a secret key (or private key for asymmetric encryption).
3. **Send JWT**: The JWT is sent back to the client, typically stored in `localStorage` or as a cookie.
4. **Subsequent Requests**: The client sends the JWT in the HTTP `Authorization` header (e.g., `Bearer <token>`).
5. **Validation**: The server verifies the JWTâ€™s signature using the secret key. If valid and not expired, it trusts the embedded user data without checking memory.
6. **Response**: The server processes the request and sends a response.

### ðŸŸ¢ Benefits
- **Stateless**: The server doesnâ€™t store session data, reducing memory usage.
- **Scalable**: Easily scales across multiple servers since no session storage is needed.
- **Cross-Service Use**: JWTs can be used for Single Sign-On (SSO) across different services.

### ðŸ”´ Downsides
- **Security Risks**: If a JWT is leaked, an attacker can use it until it expires.
- **Revocation Challenges**: Revoking a JWT before its expiry is difficult and often requires additional mechanisms.

## Key Takeaway
- **Sessions**: The server remembers who you are by storing session data.
- **JWT**: You carry your own proof (the token), and the server only verifies its signature.

Choose session-based authentication for simpler, single-server applications with manageable user loads. Opt for JWT-based authentication for scalable, stateless systems or when implementing SSO across services. Each approach has trade-offs, so the choice depends on your applicationâ€™s needs.
